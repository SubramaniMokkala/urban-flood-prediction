# Urban Flood Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project develops and compares multiple machine learning models to predict urban flood risk in high-risk US coastal cities using historical weather and climate data.

## Objectives
- Analyze 10+ years of historical weather data from NOAA
- Build predictive models using classical ML (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning (LSTM)
- Compare model performance and identify key flood risk indicators
- Provide insights for climate adaptation and disaster management

## Target Cities
- New Orleans, Louisiana
- Houston, Texas  
- Miami, Florida

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **In Development** - Data Collection Phase  
Started: October 16, 2025

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git

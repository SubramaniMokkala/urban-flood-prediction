# Urban Flood Prediction - Project Status

## Last Updated: October 16, 2025

## âœ… Completed

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Exploration
- [x] GitHub repository created
- [x] NOAA weather data collected (2010-2025, 5,753 days)
- [x] NOAA Storm Events flood data collected (163 events, 67 unique days)
- [x] Data loaded and explored in Jupyter notebook
- [x] Target variable created (1.16% flood rate)
- [x] Key insights identified:
  - Mean precipitation on flood days: 44.93mm
  - Mean precipitation on non-flood days: 4.05mm
  - 18 flood days with <10mm rain (multi-day accumulation effect)
  - Peak flood months: May, July (hurricane season)
- [x] Visualizations created (precipitation distributions, time series, monthly patterns)
- [x] Feature engineering completed:
  - Temporal features (month, season, hurricane season flag)
  - Rolling windows (3/7/14/30-day precipitation sums)
  - Lag features (1-3 day precipitation history)
  - Weather type indicators
  - Temperature features

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Tomorrow)

### Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & Model Building
- [ ] Handle missing values (7 PRCP, 40 AWND)
- [ ] Train/test split (stratified due to class imbalance)
- [ ] Baseline model (Logistic Regression)
- [ ] Random Forest model
- [ ] XGBoost model
- [ ] Handle class imbalance (SMOTE/class weights)
- [ ] Model evaluation and comparison

## ðŸ“Š Key Statistics
- **Total days:** 5,753
- **Flood days:** 67 (1.16%)
- **Non-flood days:** 5,686 (98.84%)
- **Features created:** ~40
- **Data quality:** Excellent (>99% complete)
